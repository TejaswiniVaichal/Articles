# Linux is Fun in Terminal
Linux is fun! Huhhh. OK so you don’t believe me. Mind me at the end of this article you will have to believe that Linux is actually a fun box.
### Funny Commands in Linux 

#### 1. Command: sl (Steam Locomotive)
You might be aware of command ‘ls‘ the list command and use it frequently to view the contents of a folder but because of miss-typing sometimes you would result in ‘sl‘, how about getting a little fun in terminal and not “command not found“.


- aview Command

How about viewing an image in ASCII format on the terminal? We must have a package ‘aview‘ installed, just apt or yum it. I’ve got an image named ‘elephant.jpg‘ in my current working directory and I want to view it on the terminal as ASCII format.
```
# asciiview elephant.jpg -driver curses 
```
